## Introduction

For my first project, I have created a reader app to save [DEV](https://dev.to) posts and read them later. I hope to demonstrate my understanding of the MVC pattern.


## Functions

With the app, the user is able to

- list all saved posts
- add and save a post to read later (by giving the relevant URL)
- display and read a saved post
- mark a post as read or unmark a marked post (like ticking a checkbox)

## Specs

This app is coded with Ruby 2.6.5 and can be opened in Terminal through the file 'app.rb'. All posts are saved onto the CSV file 'posts.csv'. There are already a few existing entries in the CSV file.
