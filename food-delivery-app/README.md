## Introduction

As part of my Le Wagon course, I have created a food delivery app to help a restaurant organise deliveries. I hope to demonstrate my understanding of the MVC pattern with the inclusion of multiple models.


## Functions

The welcome interface of the app is a login page, where users can either login as a manager or a delivery guy.

As a manager, the user can do the following:
- Add a meal onto the menu
- View all meals on the menu
- Add a customer into the customer database
- View all customers on the database
- Create an order and assign it to a delivery personnel for delivery

As a delivery guy, the user can do the following:
- View all undelivered orders assigned to them
- Mark order as delivered


## Specs

This app is coded using Ruby 2.6.5 and can be opened in Terminal through the file 'app.rb'.

All data are saved onto different CSV files such as  'customers.csv', 'employees.csv', 'meals.csv' and 'orders.csv'. There are already a few existing entries in each CSV file.
